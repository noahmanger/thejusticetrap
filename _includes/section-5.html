     <p>Today, there is an unprecedented call for changing our broken criminal justice system. From #blacklivesmatter to #endmassincarceration, we all are asking hard questions about how we can help.</p>
     <p>The Justice Trap will harness and channel this momentum, first by empowering users to understand the polices and practices that drive this broken system through the voices of those trapped in the cycle, and second to connect users directly to the reform movements in need of support.</p>

    <div class="text-column">
     <p>A multimedia collaboration, between defendants, lawyers, advocates, designers and artists, The Justice Trap will combine interactive web design and visual storytelling to illustrate key areas in need of reform.</p>
  	 <p>The goal: broad overhaul of the system by activating the public and policy makers around specific and actionable reforms.</p>
